# Roadmap: Transforming Dev-Snippet into "Obsidian for Developers" 🚀💎✨

To evolve this project into a powerhouse like Obsidian, but tailored specifically for developers, here are the top 20 suggested features and improvements:

## 1. Networked Thought (The Core)
1.  **Backlinks & Out-links Panel**: A dedicated sidebar tab showing which snippets link TO the current one and which ones it links TO.
2.  **Interactive 2D Graph View**: A force-directed graph to visualize your entire knowledge base and the connections created via `[[WikiLinks]]`.
3.  **Block-Level References**: The ability to link to a specific line of code or a specific header within a long snippet (e.g., `[[MySnippet#^block-id]]`).
4.  **Transclusion/Embedding**: Dynamically display the content of one snippet inside another using `![[SnippetName]]`.

## 2. Professional Metadata & Organization
5.  **YAML Properties Editor**: A clean UI at the top of the editor to manage front-matter (tags, status, priority, author) without manually typing YAML.
6.  **Vibrant Tag Explorer**: A hierarchical tag view (e.g., `#dev/react/hooks`) with usage counts and filtering capabilities.
7.  **Workspace Profiles**: The ability to switch between sets of snippets (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Thesis") with different sidebar layouts and pins.
8.  **File System Watcher**: Option to sync a local folder of `.md` files directly into the app, allowing you to use external editors like VS Code alongside Dev-Snippet.

## 3. Advanced Editor Features
9.  **Canvas Mode**: An infinite whiteboarding canvas where you can drag snippet cards, connect them with arrows, and group them visually.
10. **Callout Support**: Support for Obsidian-style admonitions like `> [!INFO]` or `> [!WARNING]` with custom icons and colors.
11. **Code Block Templates**: A library of "Slash Commands" (`/`) to quickly insert boilerplate structures for different languages.
12. **Split Panes & Tab Groups**: A robust window management system to view multiple snippets side-by-side or stacked in vertical/horizontal groups.

## 4. Power User Workflow
13. **Extensible Plugin System**: A small API that allows users to write custom JavaScript "Plugins" to add new UI elements or processing logic.
14. **Daily Notes & Calendar**: A dedicated workflow for timestamped developer logs, integrated with a visual calendar heatmap.
15. **Version History (Gitty)**: Local version snapshotting or direct Git integration to view diffs and revert snippets to previous states.
16. **Global Search Operators**: Powerful search filters like `tag:#bug`, `path:src`, or `created:2024-12`.

## 5. Intelligence & Export
17. **AI Semantic Search**: Use local embeddings to search by "meaning" so finding "how to sort an array" works even if the snippet doesn't contain those exact words.
18. **Documentation Publishing**: A one-click export to turn a folder of snippets into a clean, searchable static documentation site (HTML/JS).
19. **Mini-Browser Detach**: Enhance the Mini Browser to allow "Always on Top" code reference windows that float over your main IDE.
20. **Mobile Bridge**: A lightweight mobile app or web-relay for viewing and quick-capturing snippets from your phone.

**Vision**: *A tool that understands your code relationships as deeply as a compiler, with the visual elegance of a premium design system.* 🥂✨💎🛡️🚀
