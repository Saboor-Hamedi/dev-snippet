**Built for developers who hate interrupting their flow.**

When you're deep in the zone and need to save that perfect regex, API response, or config snippet, you don't want to open a new IDE tab or search through messy text files. Quick Snippets gives you a lightning-fast, distraction-free space for those micro-knowledge pieces that deserve to be saved but don't belong in a full project.

## The Philosophy: Less Friction, More Flow

Quick Snippets was born from frustration with existing tools that were either:

- **Too heavy** (full IDEs for 10 lines of code)
- **Too simple** (plain text files with no organization)
- **Too slow** (cloud apps requiring authentication)

I wanted something that feels like an extension of my muscle memory — a tool that appears when I need it and disappears when I don't.

## What Makes It Special

### **Instant Capture**

- **Ctrl/Cmd+N** → New snippet immediately focused and ready
- **Drag & drop** files directly into the app
- **Auto-save** every keystroke (never lose work)

### **Smart Organization**

- **Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P)** – Fuzzy-search through all snippets instantly
- **Live Markdown Preview** – See formatted results as you type
- **SQLite Backend** – Local, fast, reliable storage that syncs nothing to the cloud

### **Keyboard-First Workflow**

- **Ctrl+R** – Rename selected snippet
- **Ctrl+Shift+C** – Copy snippet to clipboard
- **Delete key** – Remove with confirmation
- **Esc** – Smart modal hierarchy (closes only what's relevant)

### **Clean, Focused Interface**

```javascript
// No bloat. No distractions.
// Just your code and a live preview.
```

## Perfect For...

### Daily Developer Tasks

- Saving **one-off commands** you always forget
- **API examples** and curl commands
- **Config snippets** for different environments
- **Bug reproduction** templates
- **Code review** notes and templates

### Beyond Just Code

- Meeting notes in Markdown
- Quick calculations
- Project ideas
- Contact templates
- Issue descriptions

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # For development
npm run build  # For production
```

### First 60 Seconds

1. **Ctrl+N** – Create your first snippet
2. Give it a name (`.js` extension auto-detects language)
3. Type some code – watch it auto-save
4. **Ctrl+P** – Search for it
5. **Ctrl+Shift+C** – Copy it back to your main project

## Why This Works

The magic is in the constraints:

- **No folders** – Search instead of organizing
- **No cloud sync** – Local-first means instant
- **No tabs** – Single focus reduces cognitive load
- **No settings** – It just works
